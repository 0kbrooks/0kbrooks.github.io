        <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
        <p>Hilachas is a traditional stew that originates from the Sacatepequez department of Guatemala. The name of this famous Guatemalan dish literally translates to “threads” in English. The threads describes the appearance of the beef shredded into thin strips.</p>
        <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb. of boneless beef brisket (or flank steak)</li>
            <li>2 Garlic cloves</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>10 Tomatoes, ripe</li>
            <li>2 Red bell peppers</li>
            <li>10 Tomatillos</li>
            <li>2 Onion</li>
            <li>Garlic cloves</li>
            <li>0.5 Teaspoon of sugar</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 lb. of potatoes, peeled and sliced</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of powdered beef bouillon</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>PREPARATION</h2>
        <h3>COOK MEAT</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Place the beef in an instant pot with water, two garlic cloves, and a pinch of salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Secure the lid, and cook for 90 minutes at high pressure. Let the pressure release naturally.</li>
            <li>Take the beef out of the pot, place it on a plate, and let it sit until cooled. Set aside one cup of boiled water for the stew.</li>
            <li>Shred the beef into strips using a pair of forks. The meat will be tender enough to fall apart. </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>MAKE THE RECADO SAUCE</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>While the meat is cooking, take out a large pot, pour enough water to cover the tomatoes, tomatillos (miltomates), red peppers, onion, garlic, and sugar. Add salt and pepper to taste and bring to a boil until they are soft and the tomato skin starts coming off. </li>
            <li>Peel the tomatoes so as not to have any coarse flakes and put everything in a blender. Blend until smooth (it should look like a thin sauce), adding a little of the water you set aside from the boiled beef.</li>
            <li>Return the recado sauce to the same large pot and check the seasoning.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>FINISH UP</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Add the shredded beef, potatoes, and beef bouillon to the recado sauce. Cook on low heat for about 10 to 15 minutes. Check the potatoes for doneness, making sure you don’t overcook them.
            <li>The beef stew will be ready when the potatoes are fully cooked, and all the flavors are well blended.
            <li>Serve with white rice.
        </ul>
